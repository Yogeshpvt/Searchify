# Search_Engine_Splay_Tree 
This is a mini project using C++ and concepts of advanced data structures - Splay tree, Structure and class. 
This project mimics the functionality of a web browsers search engine.
 I have used Splay trees as the main data structure because every time a particular record is accessed, it will reach to the root of the splay tree which makes the access faster. 
Other stuffs like structures, nodes and classes have been used to implement this project.
